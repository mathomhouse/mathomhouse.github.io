    <h1>Chaos Crafting Guide</h1>
    <p><em>Updated: February 02, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> This has no impact on the quality of the gear you receive, this method is purely in search of runes because they are the most powerful things in the game right now.<br><br>
      <strong>Note 2:</strong> I‚Äôll use terms like ‚Äúin the pocket‚Äù like a degenerate, but it‚Äôs a thing. Do this enough and you‚Äôll get it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea behind chaos crafting is to introduce as much RNG/randomness as possible into the algorithms that determine whether or not you get a rune with your titan gear. I‚Äôm convinced there are actually 3 ‚≠êÔ∏è systems in the game affecting drops after a few thousand crafts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Secret catch-up system for those who aren't crafting often or in significant numbers to produce more runes</li>
      <li>The tracker for each gear</li>
      <li>The tracker for overall gear (hence why priming multiple gear at once in this method)</li>
      <li>‚≠êÔ∏è 4. Probably fake, but game-wide system for tracking, which is where my ‚Äútiming‚Äù section comes from</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As such, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been crafting during office hours and for myself when going for runes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I cannot guarantee this will work for you, only that it has worked wonders for me and so far for every single person that has attended office hours with at least 15 gold catalysts on hand.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Recommended <strong>Minimum</strong> Catalyst Counts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>20 to 25 Gold Catalysts</li>
      <li>25 to 40 Purple Catalysts</li>
      <li>50 to 80 Blue Catalysts</li>
      <li>Also helps to have a large supply of titan gear materials</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These counts give enough flexibility to fully execute a great round of chaos crafting, although people have done it successfully with smaller quantities.</p>

    <h2>Building Gold Catalysts, Forcing Golds, Forcing Runes, Timing, Getting ‚ÄúIn the Pocket‚Äù</h2>

    <h3>Building Gold Catalysts</h3>
    <p>
      There are a few ways to <strong>reliably</strong> build up gold catalysts. The best method I can provide is aiming to craft 5 gold gear per titan blessing using <strong>only</strong> blue and purple catalysts. Yes, there is a blessing effect. No, I don‚Äôt think it matters much. Doing this gains 1-3 gold cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find yourself ‚Äúin the pocket,‚Äù go to 10 crafts with blues and purples. Custom Rewards and Weekly Pass are good ways to build catalysts. Avoid Supreme Pass until able to reach level 5 for Weekly Pass level.
    </p>

    <h3>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Forcing Golds</h3>
    <p>
      When crafting, if blues aren‚Äôt putting out within 5 or 10x crafts, switch to a purple 5 or 10x, get a gold, rotate back down to blues.
    </p>

    <h3>‚ÄºÔ∏è Forcing Runes</h3>
    <p>
      Track which gear has produced runes recently and which has been edging. If you want the gear to ‚Äúbust‚Äù metaphorically, and it‚Äôs been edging, crank up the chaos with a focus on that gear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I‚Äôve seen 3-4 golds from a gear, I consider it primed and typically hit a 10x blue/purple on it in passing. If it‚Äôs been 6-7 since a rune, I usually crank 5x gold cats. (I hit double rune drops this way fairly often, over 20 times).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hit a rune? Exclude that gear until you‚Äôve hit 2 more runes elsewhere, then add it back into rotation. This gives 2 standard gear and the gun/shield as eligible rune candidates.
    </p>
    <p>I‚Äôll work on getting more reliable numbers for this during the next 5 office hours.</p>

    <h3>Timing</h3>
    <p>
      This is entirely anecdotal, but after thousands of crafts, I don‚Äôt recommend crafting right around reset for runes. Non-peak hours seem to always produce better results.
    </p>

    <h3>‚ÄúIn the Pocket‚Äù</h3>
    <p>
      Dumb gambling superstition. If you‚Äôre finding a lot of success, even at 50 crafts, keep going. Same with the buildup of 5 or 10 crafts for gold cats. If runes are dropping hot, let it happen. Same if hitting lots of gold gear. There‚Äôs a huge number of variables in play. Don‚Äôt try to figure them out.

    <h2>Chaos Crafting (System)</h2>

    <h3>During Titan Blessing Only</h3>
    <p>
      I use the following method, always starting with Blue and Purple Catalysts (see ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è above), then Gold:
    </p>

    <h4>Blue Catalysts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5x or 10x at a time</li>
      <li>Craft different gear at random for every 5x-15x craft, based on materials available and worst titan gear slots on main march</li>
      <li>If you have a lot of blue catalysts, start with 10x and switch after hitting 1-2 golds</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Purple Catalysts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 or 5 at a time (I do 5 only when I have 20+ purples)</li>
      <li>If 5x at a time, follow blue catalyst logic</li>
      <li>If 1x at a time, follow gold catalyst logic</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Gold Catalysts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft a random gear 2x or 3x in a row (change between 2x-4x randomly to maximize RNG)</li>
      <li>After 2 or 3 crafts, jump to another gear type</li>
      <li>I usually start with normal gear: gloves, headphones, boots, triangle, to aim for more damage increase (doesn‚Äôt matter really)</li>
      <li>If low on materials, stick to the 4 core pieces (Optical Triangle, Headphones, Gloves, Boots)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>After Exhausting Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recycle anything without <strong>Damage Increase, Decrease, or DEF</strong></li>
      <li>Keep single stat gear for main unit type with Damage/DEF</li>
      <li>Recycle gear with a blue stat not for your <strong>usable unit types</strong> (small players focus on one unit type)</li>
      <li>Repeat crafting logic until reaching 50 crafts and check for red catalyst</li>
    </ul>
