    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The idea behind chaos crafting is to introduce as much RNG as possible into the algorithms that determine whether or not you get a rune with your titan gear. It has no impact on the quality of the gear you receive, this method is purely in search of runes during Titan Blessing because they are among the most powerful things in the game right now.</p>

    <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
    <p>Here’s a ballpark of what you should have to get the most out of this method:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>20 to 25 Gold Catalysts</li>
      <li>25 to 40 Purple Catalysts</li>
      <li>50 to 80 Blue Catalysts</li>
      <li>Plenty of Titan Gear materials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These counts give enough flexibility to fully execute a great round of chaos crafting, although people have done it successfully with smaller quantities.</p>

    <h2>Why This Works (Probably)</h2>
    <p>After lots of trial and error, I’m convinced a few things are going on behind the scenes when it comes to crafting for runes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Catch-up mechanics for less frequent crafters</li>
      <li>Gear-specific tracking</li>
      <li>Account-level tracking</li>
      <li>Possibly timing-based mechanics (pure speculation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Process</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is what works for me and others I've worked with, but RNG is still RNG. Your mileage may vary.
    </p>

    <li><strong>Building Catalysts</strong> - During Titan Blessing, aim to craft 5 gold gear using only blue and purple catalysts. This typically nets 1-3 gold catalysts. Weekly Pass and Custom Rewards help refill supplies. Hold off on Supreme Pass until you’re reaching level 5 Weekly Pass.</li>

    <li><strong>Getting Gold Gear Drops</strong> - If blues aren’t hitting after 5-10 crafts, switch to purple for 5-10 crafts until you land gold. Then rotate back to blues.</li>

    <li><strong>Targeting Rune Drops</strong> - Track your gear. If something hasn’t dropped a rune lately, consider it "primed." After 3-4 gold drops on a piece, try 10x blue or purple. If no rune after 6-7 crafts, go 5x gold. When you land a rune, rotate that gear out until two others have produced runes.</li>

    <li><strong>Timing (Optional, but Superstitious)</strong> - Anecdotally, off-peak hours seem better. I avoid resets. Craft consistently rather than sporadically.</li>

    <li><strong>"In the Pocket" (Hot Streaks)</strong> - When things are going well (golds, runes, whatever) keep going. Ride the wave. Overthinking kills momentum; superstition or not, it works for me.</li>

    <h2>Crafting Rotation</h2>

    <h3>Blue Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft in batches of 5 or 10</li>
      <li>Switch gear every 5-15 crafts</li>
      <li>Target weak spots on your main march</li>
      <li>Stick to 10x if you have the supply, until you hit gold</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purple Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft in 1s or 5s</li>
      <li>Use 5x batches similar to blue</li>
      <li>Use 1x batches more like gold</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gold Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft 2-4 times on the same gear, then switch</li>
      <li>Rotate gear types between short batches</li>
      <li>Start with staples: gloves, headphones, boots, triangle</li>
      <li>Stick to these four if resources are tight</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Post-Crafting Cleanup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recycle gear lacking Damage Increase, Decrease, or Defense</li>
      <li>Keep solid single-stat gear for your main unit type</li>
      <li>Recycle irrelevant blue-stat gear</li>
      <li>Repeat up to 50 crafts, then check rewards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
    <p>Chaos Crafting isn’t about guarantees. It’s about giving yourself more chances to succeed through preparation, consistency, and a little superstition. Good luck!</p>
