    <h1>Chaos Crafting</h1>
    <p><em>Updated: February 02, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>This guide walks through my personal method for crafting Titan Gear when you're hunting for runes — something I've been calling "Chaos Crafting." While this doesn’t affect the quality of the gear itself, it’s helped me and many others find more runes during Titan Blessings. Take from it what you will!</p>

    <h2>Recommended Materials</h2>
    <p>If you want a good shot at making this work, here's roughly what you should bring:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>20 to 25 Gold Catalysts</li>
      <li>25 to 40 Purple Catalysts</li>
      <li>50 to 80 Blue Catalysts</li>
      <li>Plenty of Titan Gear materials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These amounts give you enough breathing room to run a full crafting cycle. Smaller counts can still work — but more flexibility is better.</p>

    <h2>Why Chaos Crafting?</h2>
    <p>Over time, I’ve come to believe there are a few systems at play behind the scenes when it comes to rune drops:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Catch-up mechanics if you haven’t been crafting much</li>
      <li>Individual gear tracking</li>
      <li>Account-wide tracking</li>
      <li>Possibly global timing (this one’s pure speculation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Craft (My Process)</h2>

    <h3>Building Catalysts</h3>
    <p>During each Titan Blessing, aim to craft 5 gold gear using only blue and purple catalysts. This usually nets 1-3 gold catalysts in return. Custom Rewards and the Weekly Pass help build up supplies. Skip the Supreme Pass unless you’re hitting Weekly Pass level 5.</p>

    <h3>Getting Gold Gear Drops</h3>
    <p>If your blue catalysts aren’t producing after 5-10 crafts, switch to purple for 5-10 crafts until you hit gold. Then rotate back to blue and repeat as needed.</p>

    <h3>Chasing Rune Drops</h3>
    <p>Keep tabs on which gear has dropped runes recently. If something seems overdue, "prime" it with extra crafts. After 3-4 golds on one gear, try hitting it with 10x blue or purple. If no runes appear after 6-7 crafts, switch to gold catalysts for a 5x run. Once you land a rune, rotate that gear out until two others produce runes.</p>

    <h3>Timing Matters (Sort of)</h3>
    <p>This is mostly anecdotal, but I've found crafting during off-peak hours (and not right at reset) gives better results. Consistency beats randomness here.</p>

    <h3>What is "In the Pocket?"</h3>
    <p>Basically, if you're on a hot streak — gold drops, rune drops, whatever — keep going. Don’t overthink it. Sometimes chaos really is just chaos, and momentum matters.</p>

    <h2>How I Rotate Crafting</h2>

    <h3>Blue Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft in 5 or 10 batches</li>
      <li>Change gear randomly every 5-15 crafts</li>
      <li>Focus on weak slots for your main march</li>
      <li>Stick to 10x if your supply allows, until gold appears</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purple Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft in 1s or 5s</li>
      <li>Use 5x batches like blue catalysts</li>
      <li>Use 1x batches similar to how you'd handle gold catalysts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gold Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft 2-4 on the same piece, then switch</li>
      <li>Mix up gear types after short batches</li>
      <li>Start with basics: gloves, headphones, boots, triangle</li>
      <li>If resources are tight, stick to these four</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>After Crafting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recycle anything missing Damage Increase, Decrease, or Defense</li>
      <li>Keep single-stat gear for your main unit type</li>
      <li>Recycle gear with irrelevant blue stats</li>
      <li>Repeat up to 50 crafts, then check catalyst returns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Chaos Crafting isn’t about guarantees — it’s about giving yourself more chances to get lucky. Preparation helps, consistency helps, and a little superstition might just push you over the line. Good luck out there!</p>
