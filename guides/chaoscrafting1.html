    <h1>Chaos Crafting</h1>
    <p><em>Updated: February 02, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This guide outlines a structured approach to crafting Titan Gear with the goal of acquiring valuable runes. While this method does not influence the quality of gear itself, it maximizes opportunities to obtain runes through deliberate crafting patterns during Titan Blessings.</p>

    <h2>Recommended Materials</h2>
    <p>To achieve optimal results, prepare the following catalyst quantities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>20 to 25 Gold Catalysts</li>
      <li>25 to 40 Purple Catalysts</li>
      <li>50 to 80 Blue Catalysts</li>
      <li>A substantial supply of Titan Gear materials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These recommendations offer flexibility to execute a full crafting cycle. While smaller quantities may still yield success, consistency improves with preparation.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Chaos Crafting</h2>
    <p>Chaos Crafting introduces randomness into your crafting rotation to influence the game's loot systems. Based on extensive testing, several potential factors may affect rune acquisition:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Catch-up mechanisms for players crafting less frequently</li>
      <li>Tracking tied to individual gear types</li>
      <li>Account-level crafting patterns</li>
      <li>Potential (unproven) global timing factors</li>
    </ul>

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Crafting Process</h2>

    <h3>Building Catalyst Supplies</h3>
    <p>Crafting 5 gold gear items per Titan Blessing using only blue and purple catalysts typically yields 1-3 gold catalysts. While the Titan Blessing effect exists, its precise impact is debatable. Custom Rewards and the Weekly Pass are reliable sources for catalyst replenishment. Prioritize reaching level 5 in the Weekly Pass before investing heavily.</p>

    <h3>Forcing Gold Gear Drops</h3>
    <p>If blue catalysts do not yield results within 5-10 crafts, switch to 5-10 purple crafts to force a gold drop. Once successful, return to blue catalysts to continue the cycle.</p>

    <h3>Forcing Rune Drops</h3>
    <p>Monitor which gear types have recently produced runes. If specific gear has been crafted multiple times without success, increase crafting frequency to "prime" it. After achieving 3-4 gold drops on a piece, intensify crafting with 10x blue or purple catalysts. If no runes appear after 6-7 attempts, switch to gold catalysts for 5x crafts. Once a rune drops, rotate that gear out until two other rune drops occur on different gear.</p>

    <h3>Timing Considerations</h3>
    <p>Anecdotally, crafting outside of peak server hours and avoiding reset periods often yields better results. Aim for consistent crafting sessions rather than sporadic attempts.</p>

    <h3>Recognizing a Productive Streak ("In the Pocket")</h3>
    <p>When experiencing frequent gold or rune drops, continue crafting beyond typical limits to maximize gains. This approach acknowledges the unpredictable nature of RNG systems and leverages favorable streaks.</p>

    <h2>Detailed Crafting Rotation</h2>

    <h3>Blue Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft in sets of 5 or 10</li>
      <li>Rotate gear types randomly every 5-15 crafts</li>
      <li>Focus on underperforming slots on your main march</li>
      <li>If supply allows, prioritize 10x crafts until gold drops occur</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purple Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft in sets of 1 or 5</li>
      <li>For 5x crafts, follow blue catalyst rotation logic</li>
      <li>For 1x crafts, apply gold catalyst rotation logic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gold Catalysts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Craft 2-4 times consecutively on a random gear piece</li>
      <li>Change gear type after each short crafting sequence</li>
      <li>Start with common gear types (gloves, headphones, boots, triangle)</li>
      <li>If resources are limited, focus on these core pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Post-Crafting Cleanup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recycle any gear lacking Damage Increase, Damage Decrease, or Defense</li>
      <li>Retain single-stat gear aligned with your primary unit type</li>
      <li>Recycle gear with irrelevant blue stats for your unit focus</li>
      <li>Repeat the crafting cycle up to 50 crafts, then assess catalyst rewards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Chaos Crafting is a methodical yet flexible approach designed to maximize your chances of securing runes through deliberate crafting patterns. While RNG will always play a significant role, preparation and consistency increase your likelihood of success. Good luck!</p>
